# American-British English Translator

## Project Overview

This project is a full-stack JavaScript web application built for the [FreeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/) Quality Assurance certification. It translates text between American and British English using well-defined dictionaries and provides a user interface to perform and highlight translations.

The server is built with **Node.js** and **Express**, and supports both **unit** and **functional** tests using **Mocha**, **Chai**, and **Chai-HTTP**.

Users can:

- Submit a block of text to be translated from American to British English or vice versa.
- Receive translated terms highlighted with `<span class="highlight">...</span>`.
- Handle titles (e.g., `Mr.`, `Dr.`), time formats (`12:15` â†” `12.15`), and localized vocabulary.
